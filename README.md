### Inputting Info
#### Form 1

For the projection form, there are two different forms. One that prompts the user for their
name and the year they would like to retire. Once submitted, they would be brought to a
second form that asks for financial info.

#### Form 2

## Viewing Projections
Once the form has been filled out, the user is brought to a page with charts of their
projections. This was achieved through [recharts](https://github.com/recharts/recharts).
We also provided sliders so users could modify specific aspects of their savings plan
and view in real time what the changes would be.
